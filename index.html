      <h5>Early life:</h5>
      <img class="img-fluid mw-100 mh-100 w-60 p-1" src="img/1.jpg" alt="1">
      <p>Sandler was born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 9, 1966, to Judith "Judy" (née Levine), a nursery school teacher, and Stanley Sandler, an electrical engineer.
         His family is Jewish and descends from Russian-Jewish immigrants on both sides.
        Sandler grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire, after moving there at the age of six.
        He attended Manchester Central High School. As a teen, Sandler was in BBYO, a Jewish youth group.
         He graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1988.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">“I’m not comfortable being around too many people. I don’t like being out in public too much. I don’t like going to bars. I don’t like doing celebrity stuff. So, most of the characters I play are people who don’t always feel comfortable beyond their small circle of friends.” </h3>
